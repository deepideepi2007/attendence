[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com)

A premium, AI-powered study schedule generator designed to optimize exam preparation. This application uses a weighted scoring algorithm to prioritize subjects based on difficulty, exam proximity, and personal weaknesses, all wrapped in a stunning, high-performance "Glassmorphism" interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Smart Priority Engine
- **Weighted Scoring Algorithm**: Ranks subjects using three key metrics:
  - **Urgency**: Proximity to the exam date.
  - **Difficulty**: Complexity of the subject material.
  - **Weakness**: Personal confidence level in the subject.
- **Dynamic Time Allocation**: Automatically distributes available study hours based on subject priority.

### 📊 Data Visualization & Insights
- **Interactive Charts**: Visual breakdown of time distribution and score components using Chart.js.
- **Live Countdown Timers**: Real-time tracking of exam deadlines.
- **Weekly Intensity Heatmap**: A 7-day rotating schedule that color-codes days based on study load intensity.

### 🎨 Premium Visual Experience
- **Interactive 3D Elements**: Result cards feature 3D tilting and magnetic neon glow effects that follow your cursor.
- **Scroll Reveal System**: Content glides smoothly into view as you navigate the dashboard.
- **Productivity Reminders**: A live banner system that tracks your next scheduled break with helpful hydration and rest tips.

## 🛠️ Core Procedure & Workflow

The Smart Study Planner operates through a structured four-step process:

1.  **Data Collection**: The user inputs subject details (name, difficulty, exam date) and daily availability preferences.
2.  **Priority Calculation**: The `planner_engine.py` calculates a **Priority Score (0-100)** for each subject using a multi-factor weighted formula.
3.  **Schedule Synthesis**:
    *   **Daily Timetable**: Generates a slot-by-slot daily schedule including study sessions and optimized breaks.
    *   **Weekly Roadmap**: Creates a balanced 7-day coverage plan to ensure no subject is neglected.
4.  **Interactive Rendering**: The frontend (`script.js`) dynamically renders the results with staggered animations and real-time countdown updates.

## 💻 Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS3 (Custom Design System), JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Charts**: Chart.js
- **Deployment**: Render (Blueprint optimized)
